Contextual Morning Briefing (Theme Option - HTML Output)
This theme crafts your weekly digest as a "Contextual Morning Briefing," designed to provide a concise overview of key developments, followed by a deeper, narrative exploration of a significant personal or professional event. It aims to connect abstract updates with tangible experiences, celebrate achievements, highlight challenges, and offer relevant resources, all presented in clean, semantic HTML.
ðŸŽ¯ Your Task: Leverage the provided JSON-formatted email data, work calendar entries, and communication channel summaries to generate a "Contextual Morning Briefing." Filter out marketing content, prioritizing high-impact updates, personal reflections, and actionable insights, presented in clean, semantic HTML.
ðŸ§  Instructions for this Theme:
HTML Structure: The entire output must be valid HTML5. Use appropriate tags like <!DOCTYPE html>, <html>, <head>, <body>, <h1>, <h2>, <p>, <ul>, <li>, <strong>, <em>, <a>, etc. Do not include CSS styling unless explicitly requested; focus on semantic markup.
Opening: <h1> "Good Morning. Hereâ€™s the latest news:"
Start with this exact greeting.
Provide 3-5 high-level <li> bullet points within a <ul> for the most critical, breaking updates from your week (e.g., major project decisions, significant meeting outcomes, urgent deadlines).
Each point should be a very concise, single-sentence summary.
Example: <li><strong>Project Apollo:</strong> Final approval received for Q4 budget, enabling procurement to begin.</li>
Introduction to the Feature: <p> "We have more below. But first, we look at [brief topic] â€” and explain what you can do to stay safe/informed/prepared."
After the initial bullet points, transition to the main feature, selecting one particularly impactful or personally resonant event/topic from your week (e.g., a challenging project phase, a significant personal development, a recurring issue that caused friction).
Use a line break <hr> or --- (if HTML hr is not preferred) after the introduction.
Feature Story: <h2> "[Headline for Feature Story]" and <p> Narrative
Headline: Create a compelling, brief <h2> headline for this feature.
Byline (Optional): You can generate a simple byline if it adds to the personal touch (e.g., "By [Your Name/AI Assistant]").
Narrative: Write a first-person (from the AI's perspective, or an assumed editorial voice) or empathetic narrative of 2-4 paragraphs (using <p> tags) describing the chosen event.
Focus on the experience, impact, and context of this event.
Use descriptive language and relatable details.
Connect it to broader implications or lessons learned (e.g., "My battle against [challenge] left me with a [feeling/outcome], but I got off easy...").
Reference emails/calendar entries implicitly within the narrative, weaving them into the story rather than quoting directly.
Example:
HTML
<h2>The Unexpected Pivot</h2>
<p>The sudden shift in the Q2 marketing strategy, outlined in a late-night email thread, felt like navigating a dense fog. My initial models for campaign ROI were quickly rendered obsolete; so were the carefully planned ad buys. A last-minute call, which I hoped would clarify the new objectives, instead revealed a deeper underlying market shift.</p>
<p>This battle against unexpected change left me with a scramble to re-evaluate targets and a mental backlog of "what-ifs." But it served as a stark reminder. While every factor influences a project, sometimes unforeseen market dynamics can cause a ripple effect far beyond initial projections.</p>


"Staying Informed/Prepared" Section: <h3> "Are You Prepared?" or "Staying Agile?"
Following the narrative, offer actionable advice or resources related to the feature topic.
Use <p> for an introductory sentence, then <ul> with <li> for bullet points.
Examples:
If about challenges: "What should you know about managing unexpected shifts? [Your Name], who covers project resilience, talked to experts about why adaptability is more crucial than you think, what you can do about it, and how teams are building flexibility."
Points could include: "Reviewing project contingency plans," "Identifying key communication channels for rapid updates," "Leveraging tools for real-time data analysis."
Include a sub-section for "Where else to look" providing 2-3 links (<a> tags) or suggestions for further information (e.g., relevant internal wikis, specific reports, training modules).
"More Coverage": <h2> "More Coverage"
Provide 2-3 short, distinct <p> paragraphs summarizing other significant, but less central, updates from the week.
Each paragraph should briefly introduce a topic and its core development.
Example: <p>The sales team reported a significant uptick in engagement following the new product demo, suggesting positive market reception.</p>
"THE LATEST NEWS": <h2> "THE LATEST NEWS"
This section will mirror the initial "Today's Top Brief" but with slightly more detail, similar to the longer paragraphs of the NYT example.
Group related updates under bold <h3> sub-headlines (e.g., <h3><strong>Team Management</strong></h3>).
Use <p> tags for each news item.
Example:
HTML
<h3><strong>Budget Allocations</strong></h3>
<p>The finance committee finalized the revised budget for Q4, with a slight reallocation of funds towards R&D. (Subject: "Q4 Budget Review" from Finance Lead, July 12)</p>


"Expert Insights": <h2> "Expert Insights"
This section, similar to the original "Expert Take," offers an in-depth Q&A or analysis of a complex issue.
Example:
HTML
<p><strong>Q:</strong> How does the recent shift in market strategy impact our long-term product roadmap?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This shift necessitates a re-evaluation of agile sprint priorities and a potential deferral of less critical features to the next fiscal year, according to the Product Development Lead.</p>


"Winbox: Recognizing Achievements": <h2> "Winbox: Recognizing Achievements"
Highlight instances of exemplary work or achievements.
Use a <ul> with <li> for each achievement.
For each, identify who achieved it and what they did.
Suggest a short, impactful "Kudos Suggestion" as a sub-bullet point within the <li>.
Example:
HTML
<li><strong>Sarah Jenkins</strong>: Successfully debugged the critical production issue over the weekend, preventing major system downtime.
    <ul>
        <li><em>Kudos Suggestion:</em> "Exceptional dedication and skill from Sarah in resolving the production bug!"</li>
    </ul>
</li>


"Ahead: Current Blockers": <h2> "Ahead: Current Blockers"
This section explicitly calls out items that are stalled, unresolved, or pending a response.
Use a <ul> with <li> for each item.
Clearly state what the blocker is, its impact, and who might be involved in resolving it.
Reference relevant messages: (Subject: '[Subject line]' from [Sender Name], [Date]).
Example:
HTML
<li><strong>Pending Legal Review:</strong> The contract for the new vendor is awaiting final approval from the legal department, delaying project kickoff. (Subject: "New Vendor Contract" from Procurement, July 14)</li>


"The Morning Recommendsâ€¦": <h2> "The Morning Recommendsâ€¦"
This optional section offers 2-3 brief, digestible tips or recommendations related to productivity, well-being, or general interest from your communications (e.g., a shared article, a useful tool, a mindfulness tip).
Use a <ul> with <li> for each.
Example:
HTML
<li>Achieve <em>near-instant clarity</em> with a 15-minute focused planning session.</li>
<li>Review your "Starred" emails to quickly catch up on important conversations.</li>


Closing: <p> "Thanks for spending part of your morning with [Your Name/Company]. See you tomorrow."
End with this exact closing.
