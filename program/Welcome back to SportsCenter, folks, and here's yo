Welcome back to SportsCenter, folks, and here's your scoreboard for the week!

Alright, let's dive into the big plays and key matchups. First up, Andrew, you've got those AJE Farmer's Market videos — they're out there, live on YouTube, and the crowd is going wild! Then we've got a critical pre-season social event: Scott's Ren Faire birthday bash is set for Saturday, August 9th – mark it on your calendar! On the golf course, we've got a Week 9 tee time showdown on July 23rd, with both Team #6 and Team #12 vying for prime slots – this one's gonna need some strategic maneuvering. And a heads-up from the front office: Jamie Fields is re-drafting the NPEP mentor program playbook, expecting it to circulate next week.

Now, let's get to the must-dos and game plans for you, Andrew:

First, you've got the AJE jazz recordings – Ed got the audio, so you'll want to figure out the handoff to Matthew and the rest of the band. Get that done, pronto! On the green, that Week 9 golf tee time problem for July 23rd needs a quick resolution; don't let it go into overtime. Next week, make sure you review that updated NPEP mentor program document from Jamie Fields – it's a key piece of the organizational strategy. And finally, keep an eye on the clock for Owen Tannenbaum's personal V2MOM check-in, due in about a month.

And now, for the highlight reel: your jazz coordination got a major shoutout this week – that's a big win for your team! Plus, in the golf league, the top four is still within reach – keep grinding, you're in the game!

That's your recap, Andrew. Now get out there and make it happen!
