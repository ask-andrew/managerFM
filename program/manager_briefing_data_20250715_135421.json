If I encounter a challenge, Dan is patient and celebrates every milestone as I master a new concept. Patience and encouragement are among his most remarkable qualities. I consistently leave our lessons energized and eager to return to the shed to practice the new ideas. Beyond being an insightful teacher and active listener, he's also a phenomenal player whose artistry and encouraging guidance continually inspire me to refine my sound and continue my musical journey. I set a goal to play at a jam session last year. Dan helped me not only prep for the jam, but also invited me to join him. I don't think I could have taken this giant step without Dan's support and lessons. I highly recommend Dan if you're serious about growing as a musician. Andrew",

It show wins, ties, and losses. I then added columns for how many times you won a hole by just one shot or lost a hole (worth 2 points) by just one shot. Some teams had a lot of ties, like #3 with 12. Defending 2021 champs team#4 Steve and Brian had the most one point wins with 8. Former perennial champs team #1 rick/don and team #2 JJ/Bob together put up 14 holes with one shot losses and only 7 wins. TEAM #9Of all the standings one stands out to me: WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR DEFENDING CHAMPION TEAM#9 OF JOE AND PAT. well I found the answer.....they have lost ten (10) match play holes by only 1 shot. that is a pile of 20 points. With golf it will change so I see them making a comeback soon Regardsdk",

            "body": "Greetings Here is our recent results of week 7. There were changes in the almighty top 4. Hot team JimG/StevenB took 1st place and earned it. Team #3 of JimRubly/Jay made it into the top 4. teams 5 and 7 fill out the close battle. Averages were updated and sent yesterday. New worksheet 1 made with the new averages and team average number to hit also. Due to a mathematical spread of scores, we have a lot of 42 now due to improved pllay, hooray is good.We will handicap the par5 and par4 holes for averages over 52 and just the par5 for 50-51 average shooters. That should be all we need to tighten things up. If you play a now show, your team must shoot better than a total of a triple bogey and a double bogey. This means on the par3 holes the missing teams posts 11 for you to tie and 12 for you to get nothing. So just shoot 10 (two double bogies that is two 5's and you win the two points. Get it? We do not hand your 2 points if the other team is not there. Looking at my example, heck if you play anyone and your teams shoots 6 and 6 you would loose any day. See....thats is how it works. I added a page from 2024 week7, it is interesting and of a time when our beloved team #12 was top4 material. So many matches were close again. Regards,Don",

            "body": "Greetings Attached is an EXCEL sheet with your current average. This will be used ofr making your scring points for the rest of the year. A1 is the code I used for our starting average. This was last years plus I added a stroke to be nice as we got warmed up for the year. This new average is coded as A2. So this is your report card for 2025. From here forward we will use the A2 average to determine our points. It is about to get harder to get these points. I don't have the extra warm up stroke. On the far right side of the sheet your averages for 2022, 2023 and 2024 are listed. To be frank there are very little changes for most people. The sheet has rows for each person if they got a CTP or birdie or par3 par. I did not complete that yet. Note that subs do not affect your average score calculation. So here is a summary of the big changes.Don goes from 38 average to 43 a +5 change. I am way off this year.Rick goes +2JJ +1 to48Bob -4 from 52 to 48Jim Rubly +2 to 44Jay +3 to 54Steve D +3 to 47Brian +2 to 49Jeff -2 from 44 to 42Tony +3 to 44AlexT -3 from 46 to 43, he has been playing goodAndrew -1 to 52Tim Wise no change, Tim shoots 51 every yearAiden no change at 41 league lowTim McG +4 from 45 to 49John N new member +3 to 51Joe no change 47Pat +1 to 44Jim grier -7 from 55 to 48. No wonder this team is in first they both got good.SteveB +1 from 41 to 42.Jim Jo +1 from 41 to 42 but look out his scores will soon go downJim Werner -1 from 50 to 49AlexN +1 from 47 to 48Jimmie -1 from 48 to 47, new low man on team#12 lol At the bottom of the chart are the score of our subs. I left the old scores by subs in light italics, just so we know what they normally shoot. So Aiden is #1 scorer and we have several with 42. Jay and Andrew have a 1 shot handicap of the par 5, this stats at 52 average play. Just look at how close our whole league is. Today doing the match play holes over half the match play was decided by teams coming back from behind and winning the last one or two holes, just great! Just a reminder. If a team goes no show (NS) their team scores are listed as triple bogey for each man. So for a par3 hole that means each guy posts a 6 so the team posts a 12. If the team playing them has a blowup hole, 12 or more they could actually loose the hole (2 points) to the absent team. We had one case of this already this year. So next week we start playing against what we are shooting this year. To get the average point will be harder (maybe). Look at the 2022 old averages it is amazing how we do not change. If anyone would like a printout of this let me know. Regards, Don",

I'd make a list of companies I have connections to/am curioius about, then find a people leader and share what I'm trying to be better at. See if they are game to meet. Other idea was using tuition $ to level-up your leadership skills. Some courses are super helpful, especially around setting boundaries/saying no. Big temptation in leadership is to fix everything versus letting your reports learn from mistakes. I'll drop a note in a month to check-in on your personal V2MOM. Andrew <https://2ly.link/1vyWI>",

When booking the tent, you are required to use our in house caterer for all food and beverage. The caterer does have a 30-person minimum. We book our picnic shelters in 2 time slots, from 8am – 2pm OR 3pm – 9pm. The fee is $200.00 per time slot. The capacity is 50 people. You can bring your own food. Please feel free to call me if you would like to discuss in more detail or have any questions. I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you, Cindy Fracassi 847.934.6050 ex. 202",

Every year someone rises from our large group and grabs the top spots and we have four this year. It is a changing of the guard it appears. There is still lots of time left to get one of the top four spots. Enjoy the review and it looks like good weather and the front nine for tomorrow. Don",

Sadly we did not completely finish but enough progress was made to establish some sort of record. We did not award any averages points, it just didn't make sense. After the sneak attach rain deluge I left totally soaked, I drove the car bare foot. My house was filled all over with golf parts drying. My back and feet were killing me from double pace walking and carrying clubs and we were at the farthest point from home. Luckily Jeff gave me a ride. I cannot wait until next week to play the front nine. Except for hole #7, our short par4 and to me the hardest hole on the course. a Step long narrow green. Narrow fairway and even worse narrowed from the gold tees. Right side the giant hill. Water each side and the ground runs it into the water. The green has little green side chipping areas, what there is pulls the ball into the water. I hope I scared you all. Regards and dryingdon",

            "body": "Hi Section Leaders, For the fall concert, our first indoor one, the theme/working title is \"Featuring...The Band!\" I'd like for each section to have a feature piece.The goal of this is to give confidence to those members of your section who may not be the most confident. I think most, if not all members of our band are competent, but there are a good number who are not confident. If they are not confident, then they won't play their best. I'd like your help/feedback in picking the piece for your section. The goal is for the piece to be fun, engaging, and playable at a high level for everyone in your section. Also, since we will be performing in the field house, each section will stand in front of the band to perform their feature piece. Below are some ideas/pieces that I found. I am open to suggestions for others, as long as they fit the criteria above. Feel free to talk to your section about this, to get their feedback as well. Again, we want to try to get everyone excited about their feature piece! You can even share this email with them if you'd like. I'd like to have all pieces picked by our last summer concert, July 30th, so that I have to order anything that needs to be. If I don't hear back from you by July 30th, then I will just pick one for your section. Last, but not least, I'm happy to talk with you in person about any of this, just please make sure that you also follow that up with an email to me, so that I don't forget what we talked about/your suggestion.

Client ID: 227559 I received a check in the gross amount of $150.82. However, I noticed a significant deduction of $75.00, resulting in a net payment of $75.82. This deduction appears to be an administrative or check issuance fee. This represents a 50% deduction of the gross distribution, which seems unusually high and disproportionate to the small amount being distributed. Could you please provide a detailed explanation and breakdown of this $75.00 fee? Are there any alternative distribution methods available (such as direct deposit or a direct rollover to another qualified retirement account) that would have incurred lower or no fees. Given the substantial percentage of the deduction, I would also like to understand if there is any possibility of having this fee reduced or reimbursed, or if there are any options to recover a larger portion of my vested funds. Please let me know what steps I can take to address this matter. I look forward to your prompt response and a clear explanation. Thank you for your time and assistance. Andrew Ledet 630-439-5720",

I was in survival mode with my back, and it totally slipped my mind until the last piece... I will make sure everyone is recognized at the next concert! Take a listen to the recording below to hear how good we sounded! Playing in a new environment is always difficult, and you can never really hear how good the band is when you are sitting in the ensemble. *Player's Choice Recording - *https://www.youtube.com/live/ppEoMFRNM9A CSO Field Trip This Wednesday: Reminder about our band field trip to see Maestro Muti conduct the Chicago Symphony Orchestra’s rehearsal this Wednesday afternoon! Andrew was able to get 15 more tickets if others would like to join us. Contact Andrew for more details (andrew.ledet@gmail.com) Rehearsal order will start with the Frontier Days concert order. *Please check the personnel lists below for the next concerts, and let me know if I have anything listed incorrectly ASAP. * Also if your name is highlighted with a question mark, please let me know whether or not you are able to play ASAP. I want to make sure that the band stays balanced to keep our performances sounding great, so if you can't play that is fine. I just may need time to call someone to fill in for you to keep that balance, so the more lead time I have, the easier that is for me. See you soon!
